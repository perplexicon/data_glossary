## Welcome!

This document was created for the Tech Futures Lab master program, as part of a talk on data. Realising that jargon in the field is both an opaque technical blockade and a shiny marketing veneeer, I figured that an honest exposure of some terms would facilitate the conversation. 

Inspired by one of my favourite places to learn â€“ down the wikipedia rabbit hole. Linear learning is dictated; fractal learning is inspired.
